Here you will find .sol files containing notes and explanations about inheritance, ERC20, and ERC721 smart contracts in the solidity language. These are meant to be used to have examples about the syntax and very brief explanations. I recommend to use the Remix IDE to test them. https://remix.ethereum.org/

My goal here is to give clear and basic examples to help teach the foundations of the solidity language, while learning it I have noticed that every tutorial or course skims very quickly over these topics and I want to help providing the basics in a more clear format.

I will add new files regularly as they are ready.

List of explanation files:
- Inheritance.sol --> This file shows an example of inheritance with some explanations as comments.
- Deep_inheritance.sol --> This file shows an example of multilevel inheritance with some explanations as comments.
- ERC20Token.sol --> This file is the standard ERC20 token contract, I did not write those comments, or the contract itself. Check the video course for the explanation!
- ERC721NFT.sol --> This file is the standard ERC20 token contract, I did not write the contract itself. Check the video course for the explanation!

You can buy me a coffee if you wish to support me and enjoy the content here! I will greately appreciate it! https://www.buymeacoffee.com/soos3d
